Consistent Hashing is a distributed Hashing technique used for load balancing and minimize the need for rehashing upon addition or deletion of nodes.
Useful for distributed storage systems.

The method of evenly allocating keys among a group of nodes in computer systems is called consistent hashing.
Reducing the amount of keys that must be relocated on the addition or removal of nodes to a cluster reduces the effect these action have on the system as a whole.
Consistent hashing represents a virtual ring structure known as a hash ring.

Main Goal of Technique:
Reduce the number of remapping operations necessary when adding or removing nodes from the network.
