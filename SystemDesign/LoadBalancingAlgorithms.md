###Load Balancing Algorithms 
There are two forms of load balancing. Static and Dynamic:
Static: 
Predetermined number of tasks or resources that does not react to system state.
Dynamic:
Making real time decisions to distrubute network traffic or computational workload across multiple servers or resources.
